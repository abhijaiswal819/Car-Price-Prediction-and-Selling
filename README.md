# Car-Price-Prediction-and-Selling
# Final Year Project-Computer Engineering

The increased prices of new cars and the financial incapability of the customers to buy them, Used Car sales are on a global increase.
Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult.
Based on existing dataset, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.
The aim of this project is to predict the price of second-hand reconditioned and second-hand used cars in India and to sell it.
The car market has been increased steadily by around 5% for the last ten years, showing the high demand for cars by the Indian population.
